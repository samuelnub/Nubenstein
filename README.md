#[Hello!](https://samuelnub.github.io/Nubenstein/)
I don't know what this is going to be, but it's going to be some sort of wolfenstein 3D inspired clone in the world's jankiest language

(fun fact, did you know that js stands for jankyscript? yea)

Testing being done mainly on Chrome only, sorry :( Firefox/IE/Safari may not guarantee proper results
