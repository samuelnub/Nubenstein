#[Hello!](https://samuelnub.github.io/Nubenstein/)
I don't know what this is going to be, but it's going to be some sort of wolfenstein 3D 
inspired clone in the world's jankiest language. My goal is to keep it all in one file,
rely on only [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) as an external library, and
have all content made procedurally

(fun fact, did you know that js stands for jankyscript? yea)

Testing being done mainly on Chrome only, sorry :( Firefox/IE/Safari may not guarantee 
proper results. Will eventually work on making it more accessible to other browsers, and
by "eventually", I mean the _faaar_ future lol.
